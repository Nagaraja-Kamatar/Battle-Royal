# Cursor Clash - Arena Battle Game

## Overview

Cursor Clash is a real-time 3D arena battle game built with React Three Fiber where two players compete in a circular arena. Players control spherical characters and try to push each other out of bounds to score points. The game features physics-based movement, collision detection, 3D graphics, and sound effects.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Three.js via React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript, prepared for PostgreSQL database integration
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: Zustand for game state and audio management
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL (Neon Database)

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **3D Game Engine**: React Three Fiber with drei utilities for 3D scene management
- **Game Components**: Modular components for Arena, Players, Lighting, UI, and Menu
- **Physics System**: Custom collision detection and physics simulation
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard controls for two-player local gameplay
- **Audio System**: Web Audio API integration with sound effect management
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library for consistent styling

### Backend Architecture
- **Express Server**: RESTful API server with middleware for logging and error handling
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL connection via Neon Database
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer supporting both memory and database implementations
- **Development Tools**: Hot reload with Vite integration in development mode

### Game Logic
- **State Management**: Centralized game state with Zustand stores
- **Physics Engine**: Custom collision detection between spheres and boundary constraints
- **Game Phases**: Menu, Playing, and Ended states with smooth transitions
- **Scoring System**: Points awarded for pushing opponents out of bounds

## Data Flow

1. **Game Initialization**: Menu loads with game instructions and controls
2. **Game Start**: Players enter playing phase with physics simulation active
3. **Input Processing**: Keyboard events update player velocities in real-time
4. **Physics Simulation**: Frame-based collision detection and position updates
5. **Score Updates**: Boundary collisions trigger score increments and sound effects
6. **Game End**: Win condition met transitions to end screen with restart option

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Three Fiber**: 3D rendering and scene management
- **Three.js**: Core 3D graphics library
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **React Query**: Server state management (configured but not actively used)

### Backend Dependencies
- **Express.js**: Web application framework
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database ORM
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

### Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind integration

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with autoscaling:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts Vite dev server with hot reload
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` creates optimized production bundle
- **Production**: `npm run start` serves the built application
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations with `npm run db:push`
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000, mapped to external port 80

The build process compiles both frontend (Vite) and backend (ESBuild) into a single deployment package in the `dist` directory.
